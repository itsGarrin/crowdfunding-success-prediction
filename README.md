# Crowdfunding Success Prediction

This project aims to predict the fraction of a funding goal that a crowdfunding campaign will raise, based on essential campaign features. Using regression models, the project provides insights into factors that influence campaign performance, helping creators refine their strategies.

## Project Structure

- `crowdfunding_success_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory to store the dataset, expected to be at the same level as project scripts.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Various regression models are assessed for their ability to predict the fraction of funding achieved.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling of missing values, encoding of categorical features, and normalization.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Evaluates models with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to address potential data skew.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [<repo-url>](https://github.com/itsGarrin/crowdfunding-success-prediction.git)
